Notes about Cython example:


simple function:

def is callable from Python

cdef is only callable from Cython (or C)

generating C code:

$ cython cy_add.pyx

generating "annotated" C code (HTML):

$ cython -a cy_add.pyx

Look at the htmk -- the yellow highlights are places where calls into the Python runtime are used.

To build extension:

python cy_setup.py build_ext --inplace
