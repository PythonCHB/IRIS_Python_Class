Assorted links, etc for information about Matplotlib.

Installing
===========

Bulding Matplotlib (MPL) from source is a bit of a chore, though it should work OK on Linux systems. For Windows and OS-X, you're better off with binaries.

Easiest:
-----------
Anoconda and Canopy provide full featured python distributions for scientific use, including numpy, scipy and mpl.

Next easiest:
--------------
The MPL project provides binaries for the python.org builds of python:

(though they are a bit behind with the OS-X builds)
