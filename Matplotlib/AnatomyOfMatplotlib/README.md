* Introduction
This tutorial is a complete re-imagining of how one should teach users
the matplotlib library. Hopefully, this tutorial may serve as inspiration
for future restructuring of the matplotlib documentation. Plus, I have some
ideas of how to improve this tutorial.

Please fork and contribute back improvements! Feel free to use this tutorial
for conferences and other opportunities for training.

Cheers!
